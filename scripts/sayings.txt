The secret to happiness is freedom. And the secret to freedom is courage.
We won't be distracted by comparison if we are captivated with purpose.
If you're not making mistakes, you're not making decisions.
Dare to live the life you have dreamed for yourself. Go forward and make your dreams come true.
